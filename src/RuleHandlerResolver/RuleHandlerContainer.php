 * handler name to make sure that if a handler was found, then it's indeed a valid handler to work with.
 *
 * To use it, make sure to change `config.php` like so:
 *
 * ```php
 * use Yiisoft\Validator\RuleHandlerResolverInterface;
 * use Yiisoft\Validator\RuleHandlerResolver\RuleHandlerContainer;
 *
 * [
 *     RuleHandlerResolverInterface::class => RuleHandlerContainer::class,
 * ];
 * ```
 *
 * If you don't need DI container, {@see SimpleRuleHandlerContainer} can be used instead. It's enabled by default, you
 * don't need to additionally configure anything.
